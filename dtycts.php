                                <p>To participate in the Annual Dads Take Your Child to School Day Activities (DTYCTS), all you have to do is register your school/program, plan your event, host your event, and provide a brief report on the activities you held on that day. If you need assistance planning your event, we have an Organizational Guide that can help you determine what might work at your site.
                                    Remember, you are not limited to the activities in the guide.</p>
